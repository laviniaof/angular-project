# Important Info

This project was created based on an Angular Course, and the main goal is to practice and study. Here I was able to practice the basic Angular behavior and logic, and get more experience with github commit/merge/PR. 

# Task Management Project 'Taskme' ☑️

This project aims to improve my practice and understanding of working with Angular. I believe that consistent practice can help us master a technology, and that is exactly my goal.

## About the Project 🪄

'TaskMe' is an easy-to-use and educational platform for adding tasks and sharing them with your friends. Here, you can work together to better organize your team!

## Open Source Code 🪄

Feel free to help me build this platform! One of my goals is to implement the NGRX tool to manage the application state.

## How to Get Started 🪄

After cloning the code, open your terminal and run npm install.
It is important to remember that you should also have NodeJS installed.
Then, run the command ng serve to start the application locally.

## Rules 🚨
### The branch format should be:
# feature/task-you-are-going-to-do.

Following branch rules, it's important that only the objective of the branch is accomplished within it. Nothing more, nothing less.

# This README is under construction! ⚠️🚧

## Important Info ⚠️

This project was created based on an Angular Course, and the main goal is to practice and study. Here I was able to practice the basic Angular behavior and logic, and get more experience with github commit/merge/PR. 

## Task Management Project 'Taskme' ☑️

This project aims to improve my practice and understanding of working with Angular. I believe that consistent practice can help us master a technology, and that is exactly my goal.

## About the Project 🪄

'TaskMe' is an easy-to-use and educational platform for adding tasks and sharing them with your friends. Here, you can work together to better organize your team!

## Open Source Code 🪄

Feel free to help me build this platform! Here's a basic mental map to understand the components.

## Goals 🪄

- One of my goals is to implement NGRX to manage the state of application. It will be an adventure and will help me to improve my behavior behind this tool. 
- While this app grows, I will implement the backend with C# and create a simple data base.
- After this, I want to implement Apollo Service and GraphQL to manage the data base and the user be able to request the data that the user wants.
- Who knows, probably I will implement IDP and Oso Cloud tool... 👀
- If you have experience with these tools, fell free to implement it! 

## How to Get Started 🪄

After cloning the code, open your terminal and run npm install.
It is important to remember that you should also have NodeJS installed.
Then, run the command ng serve to start the application locally.

## Rules 🚨
### The branch format should be:
# feature/task-you-are-going-to-do.

Following branch rules, it's important that only the objective of the branch is accomplished within it. Nothing more, nothing less.
